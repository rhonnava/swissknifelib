Further direction for Poolkit 


= Details =

Poolkit gives out two iterators, a safe version that does not walk the pool. You can only access elements in the pool. There is an unsafe_iterator that can walk the pool if you need. You can also convert one kind to the other. Currently even unsafe_iterator can not be used with many STL algorithms as it is not yet a fully functional iterator with different operators and different typedefs that iterator_traits requires.
